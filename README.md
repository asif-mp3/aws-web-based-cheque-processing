## Step-by-Step Integration

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Use **React.js** for developing the user interface.
   - Implement **Bootstrap** for responsive design to make the web app mobile-friendly.
   - Allow users to upload cheque images for verification.
   
2. **Backend (API Layer)**:
   - Set up **AWS Lambda** to handle API requests and connect with other AWS services.
   - Use **Amazon API Gateway** for routing user requests to appropriate backend processes.

3. **OCR and Machine Learning**:
   - Integrate **Amazon Textract** for OCR processing of cheque images.
   - Train fraud detection models using **AWS SageMaker** and deploy them to the production environment.

4. **Database Management**:
   - Set up **Amazon RDS (MySQL)** to store processed cheque data and user information.
   - Manage database backups and security protocols.

5. **Data Encryption**:
   - Implement **AWS KMS** for encryption of sensitive user data and cheque details.
   - Ensure that all communication between services is encrypted and secure.

6. **Monitoring and Security**:
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring and logging of system performance.
   - Configure access control using **AWS IAM** to manage user permissions.
