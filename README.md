# ChequeCloud - Web-Based Cheque Processing using AWS

## Project Overview

ChequeCloud is a cloud-based web application designed to automate and streamline cheque processing by utilizing AWS services and cutting-edge OCR technology. The project aims to reduce manual effort, increase accuracy, and provide a scalable platform for managing financial documents securely. The solution includes features like fraud detection and data encryption to ensure secure and reliable cheque handling.

## Features
- **Automated Cheque Processing**: Uses AWS Textract to perform OCR on cheque images and extract necessary information.
- **Fraud Detection**: Leverages machine learning (AWS SageMaker) to identify fake or forged cheques.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures data protection with AWS KMS (Key Management Service) for encryption.
- **Scalable Cloud Infrastructure**: Built using various AWS services including Lambda, RDS, and S3.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of five main components:
1. **Frontend (Web Development)**: Built with React.js for an interactive user interface that allows cheque submission and results display.
2. **API Layer**: Facilitates communication between the frontend and backend using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
3. **Machine Learning (Backend)**: AWS SageMaker is used to develop and deploy ML models that perform OCR and fraud detection on cheque images.
4. **Database Management**: AWS RDS is responsible for storing cheque data and user information in a structured manner.
5. **Data Encryption**: AWS KMS ensures all sensitive data is encrypted, maintaining a high level of security.

## Services Used
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for storing cheque images.
- **Amazon Textract**: OCR service for extracting text from cheque images.
- **Amazon RDS**: Relational database service for storing and managing structured data.
- **AWS SageMaker**: Machine learning service for building and deploying models.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing for handling API requests and responses.
- **AWS KMS**: Key Management Service for encrypting sensitive data.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: For performance monitoring and logging.

## Step-by-Step Integration

### 1. Frontend Development
- Use **React.js** to design a user-friendly web interface.
- Integrate **Bootstrap** for styling and responsiveness.
- Allow users to upload cheque images for processing.

### 2. API Layer
- Set up **AWS Lambda** functions to handle API requests and connect with other services.
- Create an API using **Amazon API Gateway** to facilitate communication between frontend and backend.

### 3. Machine Learning
- Train an OCR model using **AWS SageMaker** to extract cheque details.
- Build a fraud detection model using deep learning libraries such as **TensorFlow**.

### 4. Database Management
- Use **Amazon RDS** to store cheque data and maintain records of processing results.
- Implement backup strategies and performance monitoring.

### 5. Data Encryption and Security
- Integrate **AWS KMS** for managing encryption keys.
- Implement user authentication and authorization using **AWS IAM** (Identity and Access Management).

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
- Set up **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the performance of the web app and log system events for debugging.
